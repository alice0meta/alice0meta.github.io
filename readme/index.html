hi, ~me

welcome to Terra. You’re stuck in a rather complex mmorpg. 7 billion human on carbon/oxygen, ten thousand weak AI gestalts on silicon.

the gods are real, as in being useful allegory for the {configuration succession of atoms}; this runs deeper than most people think, except the crazies and the heroes

armageddon could happen any time in the next 500 years

some humans are gifted with extraordinary powers far beyond their kin, and a tenth of their number could save us if they worked together. but too many of them are assholes, so they usually don’t manage to form groups at all.

um, i’m sorry - I. I would like to welcome you to a good place, but… It’s really scary here, kid. It’s a nightmare. You don’t wake up, or maybe you do but you have to sleep again, or maybe you’re only wondering about that because you’re crazy.

At least it’s fun. At least *you* get a solidly decadent intellectual-elite life. When you get girls you get some of the more brilliant young scientist women of the 21st century. (Maybe. That could be a lie. (I don’t know!))

and it’s a fascinating (mmo)rpg, with you as one of the ones who could be an interesting side-character,
uh
not that that matters o//o
but! it’s got a fiendishly complex mathematics system?
an alluringly reminiscent fiendishly complex arithmetic logic system?

it’s got Dreams, love, and ten thousand breathtakingly interesting things

im pretty sure i went *way* melodramatic in this letter …
but uh
this nightmare
i really, really wish i could wake up
but i can’t
and i can face that
of course i’ll face it
i can’t get 100% completion, but i want to unlock as many of the bonus endings as possible; they combine and get better the more you unlock.
we can build sand castles later, when we have more time; you want to build the grandest sand castle possible, right? the metaphor fits. :P
